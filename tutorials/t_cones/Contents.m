% t_conesDensity                - Show how human cone density varies across the retina.
% t_conesMosaicAbsorptionNoise  - Illustrate noise generation for the coneMosaic object.
% t_conesMosaicBasic            - Basic introduction to the cone mosaic object.
% t_conesMosaicHex              - Generate and use a hexagonal cone mosaic with eccentricity-based cone spacing.
% t_coneMosaicHexReg            - Generate and use a hexagonal mosaic with fixed (but custom) cone spacing and inner segment diameter.

% t_conesMosaicAbsorptionsEccBased -  Demonstrates the effect of applying eccentricity-based cone efficiency correction for a static (e.g., not modulated over time) stimulus.
% t_conesMosaicAbsorptionOISequenceEcc - Demonstrates the effect of applying ecc-based cone efficiency correction for a dynamic (ramped on/off) stimulus.
