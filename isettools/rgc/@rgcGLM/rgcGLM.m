classdef rgcGLM < rgcMosaic
% rgcMosaic using a GLM (coupled-nonlinear) computational model
%
% The coupled GLM model is published in Pillow, Shlens, Paninski, Sher,
% Litke, Chichilnisky & Simoncelli, Nature (2008). 
% 
% The computational model implemented here relies on code by
% <http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/code_GLM.html Pillow>, which is
% distributed under the GNU General Public License.
%
% rgcGLM is a subclass of rgcMosaic. It is called when creating a new GLM
% model rgcMosaic for an inner retina object.  Typically we get here from
% the inner retina object with the call:
%
%   ir.mosaicCreate('model','GLM','type','your type goes here')
% 
% See also: rgcMosaic.m, rgcLinear.m, rgcLNP.m
%
% Example:
% 
%   ir.mosaicCreate('model','GLM','type','on midget');
