classdef rgcGLM < rgcMosaic
%RGCGLM - rgcMosaic using a GLM (coupled-nonlinear) computational model
%
% rgcGLM is a subclass of rgcMosaic that uses the GLM model.  Typically it
% is invoked by a call from the inner retina object 
%
%   ir.mosaicCreate('model','GLM','type','your type goes here')
% 
% The coupled GLM model is published in Pillow, Shlens, Paninski, Sher,
% Litke, Chichilnisky & Simoncelli, Nature (2008). 
% 
% The computational model implemented here relies on code by
%  the: <a href="matlab:
%  web(http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/code_GLM.html','-browser')">Pillow Lab</a>.

        % GENERATORFUNCTION Pillow promotes the linear input voltage using a nonlinear
        % function that he calls the generator function.  By default this
        % is an exponential.

        % function and the spike coupling responses is represented here

        % POSTSPIKEFILTER These hold the parameters used in the computation.
