%   autrusseauFigure11.tif -                    TIFF image of Figure 11 from Autrusseau et al., used to digitize autrusseauFigure11.txt
%   autrusseauFigure11.txt -                    Digitized data from Figure 11 of Autrusseau et al. Tab delimited text with column headers.
%   autrusseauStandardObserver.txt -            Zernike coefficient data for the "standard observer" of Autrusseau, Thibos, & Shevell (2011),
%                                               VisionResearch, 51, pp. 2282-2294, Table 1. These start with the OSA j = 0 (piston). The
%                                               data are for a 6 mm pupil and a measurement wavelength of 570 nm.
%   berendschotEtAl2001_Figure2.jpg -           JPEG image of Figure 2 from Berendschot et al., JOSA A, 2001 used to digitize the corresponding text files.
%   berendschotEtAl2001_Figure2BoldSmooth.txt - The smooth bold curve from Figure 2. This is the SCE rho model with choroidal backscatter.
%   berendschotEtAl2001_Figure2BoldData.txt   - The mean SCE rho psychophysical data. 
%   berendschotEtAl2001_Figure2BoldSmooth.txt - The smooth thin curve from Figure 2. This is the SCE rho model without choroidal backscatter.
%   sampleZernikeCoeffs.txt -                   Zernike coefficient data for 9 subjects in OSA format, measured by Heidi Hofer.
%                                               Data for each subject, 66 coefficients in a column. OSA indexing order, starting
%                                               at j = 0. The pupil size for the measurements was 6 mm for all subjects.
%                                               Piston, tip, tilt, and defocus coefficients are set to zero.
%   ver121data -                                Directory .mat files output by an early version of the toolbox. Used to validate
%                                               that we still produce the answers that we used to, and document any differences due
%                                               to bug fixes. See v_wvfSVNVer121TestData.
