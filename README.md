NOTE: March 11, 2015: We cleaned out the isebio repository to make it more compact.  The procedure we used to do this requires that you delete your previous version of the repository and check out this clean one.  The earlier repository remains available as gitHub (isetbio/isetbio_v0.1) but we do not recommend that you use the earlier version.  The master branch in this new repository is what was the dev branch in v0.1.

The Image System Engineering Toolbox for Biology ISETBIO is a Matlab toolbox designed for calculating the properties of the front end of the visual system.  The ISETBIO code includes a portion of Image Systems Engineering Toolbox (ISET) that is sold by Imageval Consulting, LLC.  That code is designed to help industrial partners design novel image sensors. The ISETBIO portion of the ISET code is freely distributed for use in modeling image formation in biological systems. 

ISETBIO also includes the WavefrontOptics code developed by David Brainard, Heidi Hofer, and Brian Wandell.  That code implements methods for taking adaptive optics data from wavefront sensors and calculating the optical blur as a function of wavelength for model human eyes.  The toolbox relies on data collected by Thibos and colleagues.

ISETBIO also includes a set of tools, cones and rgc, originally implemented by Jon Winawer and Brian Wandell to transform cone absorptions into retinal ganglion cell spikes. These are under active development.
